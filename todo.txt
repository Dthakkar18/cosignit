- have store name be the username for user model?
- frontend and backend for:
    - user create ticket
    - user inventory
    - user sales 
    - user pending ticket
    - username already taken for user sign up
- change member model to have foreignkey with "ticket" model
    - ticket model will hold fields for:
        - status: active (approved and on sale), pending (waiting approval), sold (sold; should be useful for "sales" tab)
        - shoe info (name, sku, blah blah)
